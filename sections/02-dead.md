### Congruence

*Dec 2019 - Jan 2020*

I wanted to make a server to run unit tests and judge code submissions just like UMD's submit server. The plan was to
let users to upload code to a static store and have workers download submissions and run them against tests in ephemeral Docker containers. The unit test results could then be parsed and saved into a database. I had gotten as far
as unit testing arbitrary Python code when I ran into <s>some</s> a lot of security issues.
So many that I decided to stop.

### Sasa

*Jul 2019 - Sep 2019*

I was sad when my mobile Mastodon client disappeared, so I thought I would try to write my own.
Similarly to Kuiperbowl Mobile, I got fed up with React Native and stopped.

### Wiki Ladders

*Apr 2019*

I wanted to turn the game [Wiki Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Ladders)
into an actual web app. Eventually, I grew dissatisfied with the way it looked and stopped.
Perhaps I may re-visit the project in the future with some new ideas.

### Foodlebug

*Feb 2019 - Apr 2019*

After seeing the disorganized manner by which college students pawn off leftover food from catering and other sources,
I wanted to make a web app to connect people with leftovers to hungry students. Development was slow since I decided
I would do it in Go without a framework, and the app eventually succumbed due to a major hurdle: it was impossible to
determine how long a given food item would be available for.

### Yam Engine

*Jan 2019 - Feb 2019*

After finding out about Mogura Engine, I wanted to make my own 2D game engine in JS. Then I realized
how herculean of a task that was and kind of stopped.

### Portal Helper & Portal App

*Nov 2017 - Jan 2018*

A Java API and Android app made with a friend that attempted to interface with Portal, our county's grades system.
I ended up reverse-engineering the Portal login system at the time which paved the way for the API, but then we all graduated and
lost our school accounts which permenantly halted development on the project.

### BILL API

*Dec 2016*

A Java API for accessing BILL, my high school's one-stop shop forum/directory.
Development stopped after losing both interest and my login credentials.
