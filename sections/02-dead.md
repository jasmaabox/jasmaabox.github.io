### Sasa

I was sad when my mobile Mastodon client disappeared, so I thought I would try to write my own.
Similarly to Kuiperbowl Mobile, I got fed up with React Native and stopped.

### Congruence

I wanted to make a server to run unit tests and judge code submissions just like UMD's submit server. The plan was to
let users to upload code to a static store and have workers download submissions and run them against tests in ephemeral Docker containers.
The unit test results could then be parsed and saved into a database. I had gotten as far
as unit testing arbitrary Python code when I ran into <s>some</s> a lot of security issues.
So many that I decided to stop.

### Yam Engine

After finding out about Mogura Engine, I wanted to make my own 2D game engine in JS. Then I realized
how herculean of a task that was and kind of stopped.
