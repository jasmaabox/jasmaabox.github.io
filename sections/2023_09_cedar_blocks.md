I wanted to make something with Cedar policies and thought, "Wouldn't be cool if
you could compose security policies in a block-based environment?" Then I tried
to learn [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) which fried the last
remaining neurons in my brain as I slowly discovered that it is very difficult
to define more complicated structures in Blockly. Also I got really tired of the
blocks and also extremely unmotivated to work on it after I realized that no one
would realistically use it anyways, so I stopped.
