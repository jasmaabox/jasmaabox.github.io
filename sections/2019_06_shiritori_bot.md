I used to be really into Reddit. I was also really into learning Japanese. These
two interests combined and birthed Shiritori Bot, a bot that would moderate
[shiritori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori) games. Players could create
a post with the starting word and the game would be played in chains in the
comments, using Jisho to validate words. I ran it for a while on /r/test but got
really bored playing with myself and stopped working on it.

Side note: I got the crazy idea to put shiritori on the blockchain after this
but then the crypto bros showed up and made me not want to even think about
Ethereum.
