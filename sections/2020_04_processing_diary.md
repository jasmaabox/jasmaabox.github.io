I became enamored by Processing GIFs on Twitter at some point. Believing I could
make my own amazing GIFs, I thought to start a diary and write a small, fun demo
a day. Then I realized that learning Processing was gonna take actual effort.
Also my creative output is kinda low, so I made one spinny thing and gave up.
