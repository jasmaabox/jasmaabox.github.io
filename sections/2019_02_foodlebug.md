After seeing the disorganized manner by which college students pawn off leftover
food from catering and other sources, I wanted to make a web app to connect
people with leftovers to hungry students. Development was slow since I decided I
would do it in Go without a framework, and the app eventually succumbed to death
due to a fatal hurdle: it was impossible to determine how long a given food item
would be available for.
