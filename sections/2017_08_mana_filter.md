One of my earliest repos on GitHub. I was a summer intern <s>playing with</s>
researching VR at the time. Halfway through the internship, I got bored of
flying through Google Earth and learned OpenCV. I was also into Mousou Telepathy
at the time. In the manga, there's this character, Mana, who gets teased because
her hair drills look like croissants. Inspired by Mana, I thought it would be
funny if I could have croissant hair drills in real life and ended up modifying
an OpenCV facial recognition tutorial to post-process a picture of croissants on
my head. It actually worked quite well as long as there was enough light. The
project was sort of done at that point, so now it's here. Maybe I'll revive it
someday into a web app or something.

As an aside, during that time, I also got to see the [2017
eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017). That
was cool.
