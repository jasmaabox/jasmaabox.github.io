### Kuiperbowl Mobile

A native mobile client for my quizbowl platform, Kuiperbowl, and my first foray into mobile apps.
Abandoned after I upgraded Kuiperbowl to v3. I also got tired of running into build problems with React Native.

### NG Signal Challenge

Our team's submission to Northrop's 2019 signal challenge. The goal was to accurately classify
a wide variety of sounds into 17 classes. We tried to do this by scraping soundbites off Google
AudioSet and training ResNet to classify the waveforms via transfer learning. It did not work.

### Wiki Ladders

I wanted to turn the game [Wiki Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Ladders)
into an actual web app. Eventually, I grew dissatisfied with the way it looked and stopped.
Perhaps I may re-visit the project in the future with some new ideas.

### Fortune Cookie ML

I tried to make an RNN to classify text as fortune or not fortune. I never did figure out whether
it worked well or not.

### Emergency Vehicle Finder

Our team's submission to Northrop's 2018 image classification challenge. I did not know how to do
deep learning at the time, so we used traditional CV with Haar classifiers. It did not work.

### Falling Words

I made a physics demo with words that collided into each other a la Monogatari. The hope was to try
to do polygonal collision afterwards or maybe break up each character into polygons and try and form a mural.
Neither seemed very easy or fulfilling, so I stopped.

### py-fpff

There was a problem at UMD CTF dealing with a toy file format called FPFF. The gist was to follow the FPFF
spec and manually decode the files, so I thought it would be fun to make a tool for it. For the most part, py-fpff
works and was my first package on PyPi. However, barring the fact that no one actually uses FPFF, I have regrets
with the way I designed and wrote the tool and ended up yanking the package and archiving the repo. Perhaps I may
formally re-work it and re-release it in the future.

### Elf on the Shelf

A script I made in high school that would automatically generate Elf on the Shelf memes and tweet them to
our school broadcast program's hashtag. I made it to try and impress my then-girlfriend. Now I have many technical
and non-technical regrets pertaining to its existence.

### Portal Helper & Portal App

A Java API and Android app made with a friend that attempted to interface with Portal, our county's grades system.
I ended up reverse-engineering the Portal login system at the time which paved the way for the API, but then we all graduated and
lost our school accounts which permenantly halted development on the project.

### BILL API

A Java API for accessing BILL, my high school's one-stop shop forum/directory.
Development stopped after losing both interest and my login credentials.
