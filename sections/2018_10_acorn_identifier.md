I had found a infographic explaining how to identify different types of acorns
on a Japanese subreddit at one point. I also remember learning about expert
systems in my last year of high school, so I though it would be the perfect
opportunity to try and implement an expert system while trying out my Japanese
translation skills. I think I tried doing it in COBOL originally but realized
that I don't know anything about the language, and ended up switching to pyknow
in Python. At some point, I translated the entire infographic and embedded it in
pyknow. Then I realized no one I knew really cared about identifying acorns, so
I abandoned the project.
