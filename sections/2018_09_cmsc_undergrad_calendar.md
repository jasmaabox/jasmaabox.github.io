I've already written a blog post about this one on my main site. The gist of it
was that the UMD undergrad CS department's calendar was a nightmare to navigate
and did not mirror to a Google Calendar. I wrote some really ass Selenium to
scrape it into Google Calendar, got murdered in September by DST, lived to tell
the tale, and then promptly gave up working on the scraper soon afterwards
because I couldn't (and probably still can't) understand Google OAuth.
