[It's Academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Academic) (It's Ac) is a
local high school quiz show that the *REEAALLY* good quizbowlers at my high
school got the pleasure to be on. As practice, all quizbowl club members were
conscripted to transcribe an It's Ac game from [CBS
Baltimore](https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/category/its-academic/) into packet
form (which was a painful process since I didn't know about AdBlock at the
time). Later in life, I would imagine an automated process for automatically
transcribing and generating packets from those games which culminated into this
project. Then much later in life, CBS Baltimore would update their site and
break my script which is why this project is now housed here.
