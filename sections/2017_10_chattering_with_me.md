This was a pseudo-anonymous chatroom and one of my first web projects. I had
learned about WebSockets from a CTF and was also really into Durarara!! at the
time. Wanting to make a chatroom like the one from the show, I ended up
scrapping together something with Django Channels, made my first domain name
purchase, and deployed the app on AWS.

I also entered it into 2017's [Congressional App
Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/) and lost. Then my hacker
friend found out the site was vulnerable to XSS, redirecting everyone to Trump's
then-Twitter and teaching me the valuable lesson of input sanitization.

We had a lot of fun goofing off in research class with this until the semester
ended. Then the domain name expired and Django Channels went through a major
update which broke the app. I eventually sorted out all the dependency issues,
but by then we were all busy and in college, so I put the app to rest.

Although long dead, Chattering With Me did provide me with lots of my initial
web deployment experience. It also laid down the mental groundwork for what
would later become Kuiperbowl.
