  <h3>ICFPC 2024</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Jun 2024 - Jun 2024</em>
    <p>I saw a link to the <a href="https://icfpcontest2024.github.io/">2024 ICPF Contest</a> on
Lobsters and thought I would give it a try. I got as far as making a REPL to
talk with the server and en/decode strings before I realized I was severely
outclassed in most of the problems. I didn't really want to spend the rest of my
weekend trying to solve Traveling Salesman (or discovering that I did not in
fact need to solve Traveling Salesman), so I quit.</p>

  <h3>Squidync</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Feb 2024 - Mar 2024</em>
    <p>I was already a big user of <a href="https://hyperbeam.com/">Hyperbeam</a> for watch parties and had tried out <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/roll-together/ilpfeljgdikoabaclkjgkbeegeoijfca?hl=en-US">Roll Together</a> before. Armed with my experience from making niconico-yt, I wanted to see if I could make something nicer that could also support chat messaging.</p>
<p>I started rifling through the Crunchyroll web app HTML and found out that Crunchyroll apparently hosts its video player on a separate site and embeds it as an iframe on each episode's site for some reason. This then led me down a deep deep rabbithole that involved designing two content scripts, video and site. The two scripts would pass video playback data between each other through the background script as a proxy. The site script would then sync playback with other clients by talking via websocket to a web server which had a connection pool with all the other clients. That server would have info on which client was the leader and broadcast the leader's playback state as the canonical video state to everyone else.</p>
<p>In the end, the whole thing ended up kind of working but still had many gaps. I had not figured out a good way to synchronize all clients on the same video URL and there were still a bunch of lag and syncing issues with manipulating Crunchyroll's playback. I also ended up custom-rolling all the connection pool logic for the server by writing it in Go which may have been a bad idea since this made dev very tedious. Then at some point, Crunchyroll ended its freemium service. Since I was the only one of my friends with a Crunchyroll subscription, it became (1) very annoying to test the syncer and (2) kind of pointless since no one would use it. So I quit.</p>

  <h3>Cedar Blocks</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Sep 2023 - Oct 2023</em>
    <p>I wanted to make something with Cedar policies and thought, &quot;Wouldn't be cool if
you could compose security policies in a block-based environment?&quot; Then I tried
to learn <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly</a> which fried the last
remaining neurons in my brain as I slowly discovered that it is very difficult
to define more complicated structures in Blockly. Also I got really tired of the
blocks and also extremely unmotivated to work on it after I realized that no one
would realistically use it anyways, so I stopped.</p>

  <h3>Weather Station</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Jun 2022 - Dec 2022</em>
    <p>I wanted to try my hand at more hardware projects and thought a weather station
would be a good starting point. The idea was that the weather station would
collect data like temperature and humidity and report it to a server which would
finally display it in some charts on a website.</p>
<p>This was still during the COVID-era Raspberry Pi shortage, so the only thing I
could get my hands on at the time were Picos. These did not have Wi-Fi on board,
so I also managed to find a guide to link a Pico to an ESP32 Wi-Fi coprocessor.
I thought I would also take this as a chance to practice my soldering. I did not
do a good job at this, so much so I ended up destroying the Pico and had to buy
another one.</p>
<p>Eventually, I did get everything soldered and wired up on a breadboard. I wrote
some code for the Pico to periodically send data to a Cloudflare KV store and a
Worker to list the weather data for the website. Since I wanted the worker to
list all the data in reverse chronological order while only using a single API
call to the KV store, I ended up writing a hacky way to send the weather station
payload as metadata and <code>MAX_INT - currentTime</code> as the key. </p>
<p>After that, the whole thing did manage to work for a little bit. Then I got
stuck trying to weather-proof my setup. Shortly after, the Pico stopped
communicating with the ESP32 coprocessor again which I'm pretty sure was a
result of my less-than-stellar soldering ability (or me frying some part of the
Pico by passing more than 5V into it). I tried to debug it with a multimeter,
but I did not really know what I was doing due to a severe lack of electronics
experience. This was also not helped much by the fact that the multimeter was in
Chinese.</p>
<p>At this point, I got very fed up with the whole thing and called it done.</p>

  <h3>Processing Diary</h3>

    <p>I became enamored by Processing GIFs on Twitter at some point. Believing I could
make my own amazing GIFs, I thought to start a diary and write a small, fun demo
a day. Then I realized that learning Processing was gonna take actual effort.
Also my creative output is kinda low, so I made one spinny thing and gave up.</p>

  <h3>Cartoon Avatar</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Apr 2020 - May 2020</em>
    <p>Early on into the pandemic, I came across a project called
<a href="https://github.com/alievk/avatarify-python">avatarify</a> which used the power of
ML to let people's facial movements drive static image animation. This would
output a video stream that could then be fed via a virtual OBS camera into Zoom,
allowing you to show up in meetings with a funny avatar controlled by your face.
Live2D Vtubers were also taking off around this time, so I thought to combine
these two and try to make a shitty clone of Live2D in the spirit of avatarify.</p>
<p>My version was much simpler and just used perspective transformations to warp
images for each facial landmark. I then stitched all the images with some
scaling and translation into one and streamed it to an OpenCV window. The window
could then be captured in OBS and output as a virtual webcam, same as avatarify.
When I tested it out in Zoom, it worked terribly since Python (and my computer)
is obscenely slow. I also remember calling my friends with it, and they got
extremely confused, watching a video of a dilapidated Miho lag out on Discord.</p>
<p>Disappointed with the results and having much newfound respect for the quality
of Live2D, I stopped working on this one.</p>

local high school quiz show that the <em>REEAALLY</em> good quizbowlers at my high

conscripted to transcribe an It's Ac game from <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/category/its-academic/">CBS
Baltimore</a> into packet
form (which was a painful process since I didn't know about AdBlock at the
time). Later in life, I would imagine an automated process for automatically
transcribing and generating packets from those games which culminated into this
project. Then much later in life, CBS Baltimore would update their site and
break my script which is why this project is now housed here.</p>

    <p>I used to be really into Reddit. I was also really into learning Japanese. These

a post with the starting word and the game would be played in chains in the
comments, using Jisho to validate words. I ran it for a while on /r/test but got
really bored playing with myself and stopped working on it.</p>
<p>Side note: I got the crazy idea to put shiritori on the blockchain after this
but then the crypto bros showed up and made me not want to even think about
Ethereum.</p>

that I don't know anything about the language, and ended up switching to pyknow
in Python. At some point, I translated the entire infographic and embedded it in
pyknow. Then I realized no one I knew really cared about identifying acorns, so
I abandoned the project.</p>

    <em>Oct 2017 - Nov 2018</em>
    <p>This was a pseudo-anonymous chatroom and one of my first web projects. I had
learned about WebSockets from a CTF and was also really into Durarara!! at the
time. Wanting to make a chatroom like the one from the show, I ended up
scrapping together something with Django Channels, made my first domain name
purchase, and deployed the app on AWS.</p>
<p>I also entered it into 2017's <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/">Congressional App
Challenge</a> and lost. Then my hacker
friend found out the site was vulnerable to XSS, redirecting everyone to Trump's
then-Twitter and teaching me the valuable lesson of input sanitization.</p>
<p>We had a lot of fun goofing off in research class with this until the semester
ended. Then the domain name expired and Django Channels went through a major
update which broke the app. I eventually sorted out all the dependency issues,
but by then we were all busy and in college, so I put the app to rest.</p>
<p>Although long dead, Chattering With Me did provide me with lots of my initial
web deployment experience. It also laid down the mental groundwork for what
would later become Kuiperbowl.</p>

    <p>One of my earliest repos on GitHub. I was a summer intern <s>playing with</s>

flying through Google Earth and learned OpenCV. I was also into Mousou Telepathy
at the time. In the manga, there's this character, Mana, who gets teased because
her hair drills look like croissants. Inspired by Mana, I thought it would be
funny if I could have croissant hair drills in real life and ended up modifying
an OpenCV facial recognition tutorial to post-process a picture of croissants on
my head. It actually worked quite well as long as there was enough light. The
project was sort of done at that point, so now it's here. Maybe I'll revive it
someday into a web app or something.</p>
